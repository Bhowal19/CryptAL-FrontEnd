# CryptAL - Text Encryption and Decryption Website

CryptAL is a web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt texts securely. It uses modern encryption algorithms to protect sensitive information and ensure that only authorized users can access the original content.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Users can enter their text in the input box and encrypt it using strong encryption algorithms.
- **Text Decryption**: Users can paste an encrypted text in the input box and decrypt it using the correct decryption key.
- **Secure Algorithms**: CryptAL uses industry-standard encryption algorithms like AES, RSA, or a combination of these to ensure data security.
- **Password Protection**: Users can set a secure password or key for encrypting and decrypting their texts.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can easily copy the encrypted or decrypted text to the clipboard for further use.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, making it accessible to users of all skill levels.
- **Responsive Design**: CryptAL is fully responsive, allowing users to access it from various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Getting Started

To run CryptAL on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the CryptAL repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cryptal.git
cd cryptal
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access CryptAL.

## Encryption Algorithm

CryptAL uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the default encryption algorithm. AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency.

## Decryption Algorithm

For decryption, CryptAL uses the RSA algorithm. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that provides a secure way to decrypt data using a private key.

## Security Measures

- CryptAL does not store any user data or encryption keys on the server or client-side.
- Users are encouraged to use strong and unique passwords or keys for encryption and decryption.
- All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data during transmission.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to improve CryptAL and make it even more secure and user-friendly. If you want to contribute, follow these steps:

1. Fork the CryptAL repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b my-feature`.
3. Make your changes and commit them: `git commit -m "Add new feature"`.
4. Push your changes to your fork: `git push origin my-feature`.
5. Create a pull request on the main CryptAL repository.
