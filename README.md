CryptAL React is our newest free MUI Design System based on React. Its amazing design is inspired by Material Design and contains all the components you need for your development. If you’re a developer looking to create good-looking websites, rich with features, and highly customisable, here is your match.

_Fully Coded Elements_
CryptAL React is built with over 40 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, alerts or cards, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in color, which you can easily modify using MUI styled() API and sx prop. You will save a lot of time going from prototyping to full-functional code because all elements are implemented.

This free MUI & React template is coming with pre-built design blocks, so the development process is seamless,
switching from our pages to the real website is very easy to be done.

_Documentation built by Developers_
Each element is well presented in very complex documentation.
You can read more about the documentation here (https://Ayan Bhowal (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayan-bhowal/) and Varun Bhatacharya (https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbhattacharya/)/learning-lab/react/overview/material-kit/).

## Encryption Algorithm

<<<<<<< HEAD
We use GitHub Issues as the official bug tracker for the CryptAL React. Here are some advices for our users that want to report an issue:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the CryptAL React. Check the CHANGELOG from your dashboard on our [website](https://Ayan Bhowal (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayan-bhowal/) and Varun Bhatacharya (https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbhattacharya/)/product/material-kit-react?ref=readme-mkr).
2. Providing us reproducible steps for the issue will shorten the time it takes for it to be fixed.
3. Some issues may be browser specific, so specifying in what browser you encountered the issue might help.
=======
CryptAL uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as the default encryption algorithm. AES is a widely-used symmetric encryption algorithm known for its security and efficiency.

## Decryption Algorithm
>>>>>>> 599763fe5a1c95b01dc9b497a8f44c77c71ee572

For decryption, CryptAL uses the RSA algorithm. RSA is an asymmetric encryption algorithm that provides a secure way to decrypt data using a private key.

<<<<<<< HEAD
If you have questions or need help integrating the product please [contact us](https://Ayan Bhowal (https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayan-bhowal/) and Varun Bhatacharya (https://www.linkedin.com/in/varunbhattacharya/)/contact-us?ref=readme-mkr) instead of opening an issue.
=======
## Security Measures
>>>>>>> 599763fe5a1c95b01dc9b497a8f44c77c71ee572

- CryptAL does not store any user data or encryption keys on the server or client-side.
- Users are encouraged to use strong and unique passwords or keys for encryption and decryption.
- All communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS to protect data during transmission.
